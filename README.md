## Overivew
1. Proposed a solution to implement various models of vehicle dynamics, tire and drivetrain including single/dual track kinematics, dynamics and Multibody in using state space form.
2. Constructed Euler Integration for models of vehicle dynamics to do parameter estimation.
3. Designed different racing scenarios to estimate vehicle parameters by using numerical optimization algorithms for different vehicle models. 
4. An adaptive design to approximate the optimal parameters for the autonomous racing car.
